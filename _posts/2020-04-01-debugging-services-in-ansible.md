# Debugging services in Ansible

Sometimes services don't start and give an error like:

```
Unable to start service my_service: A dependency job for my_service.service failed. See 'journalctl -xe' for details.
```

Well, if you're testing in CI, you can't really access the instance that has an issue. So how to you troubleshoot this?

I use this pattern frequently:

```yaml
- name: debug start my_service
  block:
    - name: start my_service
      service:
        name: "my_service"
        state: started
  rescue:
    - name: collect information
      command: "{% raw %}{{ item }}{% endraw %}"
      register: my_service_collect_information
      loop:
        - journalctl --unit my_service --no-pager
        - systemctl status my_service
    - name: show information
      debug:
        msg: "{% raw %}{{ item }}{% endraw %}"
      loop: "{% raw %}{{ my_service_collect_information.results }}{% endraw %}"
```

What's happening here?

- The `block` is a grouping of tasks.
- The `rescue` runs when the initial task (`start my_service`) fails. It has two tasks.
- The task `collect information` runs a few commands, add extra is you know more and saves the results in `my_service_collect_information`.
- The task `show information` displays the saved result. Because `collect information` has a loop, the variable has `.results` appended, which is a list to needs to be looped over.

Hope this helps you troubleshoot services in Travis of Google Actions.
