# Ansible 2.7

As announced, Ansible 2.7 is out. The changed look good, I'm [testing my bootstrap role](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap) agains it.

In 2.7 (actually since 2.3) all package modules don't need `with_items:` or `loop:` anymore. This make for simpler code.

```yaml
- name: customize machine
  hosts: all

  vars:
    packages:
      - bash
      - screen
      - lsof

  tasks:
    - name: install packages
      package:
        name: "{% raw %}{{ packages }}{% endraw %}"
        state: present
```

Wow, that's simpler so better.

A [reboot](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/reboot_module.html) module has been introduced. Rebooting in Ansible is not easy, so this could make life much simpler.
