title: And, or and not

# And, or and not

Today I spent a couple of hours on a condition that contained a mistake. Let me try to help myself and describe a few situations.

# Condition?

A condition in Ansible can be described in a `when` statement. This is a simple example:

```yaml
- name: do something only to virtual instances
  debug:
    msg: "Here is a message from a guest"
  when: ansible_virtualization_role == "guest"
```

## And

It's possible to describe multiple conditions. In Ansible, the `when` statement can be a string (see above) or a list:

```yaml
- name: do something only to Red Hat virtual instances
  debug:
    msg: "Here is a message from a Red Hat guest"
  when:
    - ansible_virtualization_role == "guest"
    - ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

The above example will run when it's **both** a virtual instance **and** it's a Red Hat-like system.

## Or

Instead of combining ('and') conditions, you can also allow multiple condition where **either** is true:

```yaml
- name: do something to either Red Hat or virtual instances
  debug:
    msg: "Here is a message from a Red Hat system or a guest"
  when:
    - ansible_virtualization_role == "guest" or ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

I like to keep lines short to increase readability:

```
  when:
    - ansible_virtualization_role == "guest" or
      ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

## And & or

You can also combine `and` and `or`:

```yaml
- name: do something to a Debian or Red Hat, if it's a virtual instances
  debug:
    msg: "Here is a message from a Red Hat or Debian guest"
  when:
    - ansible_virtualization_role == "guest"
    - ansible_os_family == "RedHat" or ansible_os_family == "Debian"
```

## In

It's also possible to check if some pattern is in a list:

```yaml
- name: make some list
  set_fact:
    allergies:
      - apples
      - bananas

- name: Test for allergies
  debug:
    msg: "A match was found: {{ item }}"
  when: item in allergies
  loop:
    - pears
    - milk
    - nuts
    - apples
```

You can have multiple lists and check multiple times:

```yaml
- name: make some list
  set_fact:
    fruit:
      - apples
      - bananas
    dairy:
      - milk
      - eggs

- name: Test for allergies
  debug:
    msg: "A match was found: {{ item }}"
  when:
    - item in fruit or
      item in dairy
  loop:
    - pears
    - milk
    - nuts
    - apples
```

## Negate

It's also possible to have search `in` a list negatively. This is where it gets difficult: (for me!)

```yaml
- name: make some list
  set_fact:
    fruit:
      - apples
      - bananas
    dairy:
      - milk
      - eggs

- name: Test for allergies
  debug:
    msg: "No match was found: {{ item }}"
  when:
    - item not in fruit
    - item not in dairy
  loop:
    - pears
    - milk
    - nuts
    - apples
```

The twist here is that **both** conditions (`and`) should not be true.

Well, I'll certainly run into some issue again in the future, hope this helps you (and me) if you ever need a complex condition in Ansible.
